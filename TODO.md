TODO
====

* Add shader support
* Implement a few trigger-based patterns for better VCV Rack integration.
* Add topology support
* Add FFT input support to shaders (investigate per-channel FFT from VCV Rack)
* Test Bluetooth LE beacon integration.
* Somewhat fully formed VCV Rack 3 channel audio example.
* Move over SuperCollider multi-channel streaming sample player.
* Spec necessary hardware (vcv rack is cpu intensive)
* Chromatik - VCV Rack patch playing automation. Starting and stopping patches.
* Implement custom modulators as placeholders for twist angle values.
* Implement custom modulators as placeholders for interactive audio inputs. (joysticks + buttons)
* Implement custom modulators as receivers for Beacon telemetry.
