Interlace

Interlace is a family of three hyperboloids. When in motion, hyperboloids seem to curve and bend, yet are only composed of rigid, straight lines. As participants rotate the outer ring, these strange creatures twist; transforming from a linear body into an elegant hourglass figure and back again.
